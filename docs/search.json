In these cases, it is necessary to use the percept of the object to make a decision which of several possible objects is present at the moment. In general terms, these decisions are characterized by three properties: First, humans can make a correct or an incorrect decision which of the objects is present. Second, it may take varying periods of time until a decision is accomplished. Finally, humans may feel a greater or lesser degree of confidence about having made the correct decision about the object. However, the existing mathematical theories of decision-making are not able to provide a satisfactory explanation for accuracy, decision time, and confidence at the same time. The goal of the project was to provide and test a mathematical theory of choice, confidence, and decision time. For this purpose, we extended the weighed evidence and visibility model, a recently proposed theory of choice and confidence, to include decision time as well."
